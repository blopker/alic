<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](alic2-sc.min.png)

Alic makes it simple to compress images. It's a great tool for quickly compressing images for the web, or to share with clients.

Why compress images?

- Faster load times
- Less bandwidth usage
- Better SEO
- Better user experience

And security: Many cameras and phones embed metadata in images, which can include location, camera model, and other sensitive information. Alic can remove this metadata for you.

Supported image formats:

- JPEG
- PNG
- WebP
- GIF
- TIFF

Alic is heavily inspired by [ImageOptim][imageoptim-url], but with modern compression algorithms for smaller files and speed. See [Differences from ImageOptim](#differences).

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page][project-release-url]
2. Drag to Applications folder
3. Launch and enjoy!

## Usage

Drag and drop images (or folders) into the window, images will automatically start compressing. The compressed images will be saved in the same directory as the original images.

Having trouble? Hover over the status icons for helpful hints!

## Privacy

Your data stays on your machine! No sneaky analytics or tracking here. Alic doesn't phone home, which means you'll need to manually check for updates through the [releases page][project-release-url] or by clicking "Check for Updates" in the app menu bar.
